# UofT Tutor Club Wechat Miniprogram
For better development of our tutor club, we propose this Wechat Miniprogram. Our basic idea is to introduce our club information to more people, including our team, goal and what we do. Also making it more convenient to conduct classes, make appointments and more.

## How to Setup for Development?
1. Download the [WeChatDevTool](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/dev/devtools/download.html) (Stable Build recommanded) <br/>

- The development tool should look like this (maybe in Mandarin)<br/>

2. Clone this repostory to your PC (Github Desktop/Command Line)
  - Github Desktop
    - The recommanded way is to use the [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Github Desktop simplifies the development workflow, even if you are not that             familiar with git, you can contribute to this repository without a problem using the Github Desktop.
    - After downloading the Github Desktop, you should go to File->Clone repository, copy the URL of this repository from <br/>

3. Open the code with following setting (目录填写miniprogram文件夹的location) APPid: wxfc0a0ae443f9a74d
![Setting](https://github.com/Yuanxyyds/webserver/blob/main/Intro.png?raw=true)

4. Create your own branch at this repo, git push your changes to your branch

5. 改好了我来上传code，大家就每次本地编辑code, git pull + git push到github就好了 （我们不需要用wechat自带的version control，所以只需要通过github share code就好，我最后上传）
