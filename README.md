# UofT Tutor Club WechatMiniprogram
For better development of our tutor club, we propose this Wechat Miniprogram. Our basic idea is to introduce our club information to more people, including our team, goal and what we do. Also making it more convenient to conduct classes, make appointments and more.

## How to setup development tools?
1. Download the WeChatDevTool from [here](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/dev/devtools/download.html) (Stable Build recommanded)

2. Clone this repostory on your PC

3. Open the code with following setting (目录填写miniprogram文件夹的location) APPid: wxfc0a0ae443f9a74d
![Setting](https://github.com/Yuanxyyds/webserver/blob/main/Intro.png?raw=true)

4. Create your own branch at this repo, git push your changes to your branch

5. 改好了我来上传code，大家就每次本地编辑code, git pull + git push到github就好了 （我们不需要用wechat自带的version control，所以只需要通过github share code就好，我最后上传）
